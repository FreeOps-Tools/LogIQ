# Contributing Guide

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue before making a change.

## How to collaborate

You can [open an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/) and give us your suggestions as to how we can improve this open- source project to improve the experience.

You can also [fork this project](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and send a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) to fix any mistakes that you have found.

## Issues & Pull Requests

### Creating an Issue

Before **creating** an Issue for `features`/`bugs`/`improvements` please follow these steps:

1. search existing issues before creating a new issue (probably someone raised this already)
1. if it doesn't exist create a new issue giving as much context as possible (please select the correct Issue type, for example `bug` or `feature`)
1. comment on the Issue asking for it to be assigned to you.
1. **only** start working on this issue (and open a Pull Request) when it has been assigned to you - this will prevent confusion, multiple people working on the same issue and work not being used.

### Working on an Issue (get it assigned to you)

Before working on an existing Issue please follow these steps:
1. do **not** enable GitHub Actions on your fork
1. reference the Issue in your Pull Request (for example `closes #123`)

Please note we have a [LogIQ's code of conduct](https://github.com/ossu/code-of-conduct). please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Pull Request Process

Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.

Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.


> Notes:
> - any issues that have no activity after 3 weeks will be unassigned and re-assigned to someone else
> - only request to be assigned an issue if you know how to work on it

## Reviewing Pull Requests

We welcome everyone to review Pull Requests, it is a great way to learn and network.
